#Bolt coding style standard

##PHP

[Bolt](https://github.com/bolt) tries to adhere a coding style based on PSR-2 and the Symfony2 coding standard.
To help following our standard a ruleset for [PHP_CodeSniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer) is
provided here in folder `PhpCodeSniffer`.

##Javascript

There's no explicitly written style yet, but when creating the files needed for Bolt using the grunt toolchain there's
a target linting the javascript code.
